# Note: this blazar yaml has been copied to all of the maven submodules (EXCEPT hbase-assembly) so
# that they can be properly configured. If you make changes to this, you will need to make sure all
# submodules are also updated accordingly. If you added a new submodule, you'll need to make sure
# it gets a copy of this .blazar.yaml. In either case, use copy_blazar_yaml.sh to copy to all
# subdirs containing a pom.xml.
# Make sure to also check hbase-assembly/.blazar.yaml to see if any changes should be added there as well.
# Prefer making changes to prepare_environment.sh instead, if possible.

# The build environment requires environment variables to be explicitly defined before they may
# be modified by the `write-build-env-var` utilty script to persist changes to an environment variable
# throughout a build
